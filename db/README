download the latest monthly release to /cellar/data/cellcircuits

	http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/

	tar zxvf go_200609-assocdb-tables.tar.gz


logon to chianti ( ssh -X chianti ) since this is where mysql currently lives

cd into the db directory of your svn checkout of cellcircuits

	for example, i checked out cellcircuits to my home directory,
	so for me, this translates to 
	
	cd ~/cellcircuits/trunk/db

load the GO tables

	./step1_load_GO_tables.pl go_200609-assocdb-tables GO_tables_list.txt

	go_200609-assocdb-tables is the directory that resulted
	from the tar zxvf command in /cellar/data/cellcircuits

	GO_tables_list.txt is a file with a line foreach of the
	names of the GO tables we wish to load into mysql

	NOTE(S):
		(1) this script populates the db called cellcircuits_dev
			and in doing so, will most likely overwrite any
			data that previously existed in it
