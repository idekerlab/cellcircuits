==ABSTRACT
We have generated a genomic phenotyping database identifying hundreds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes important for viable cellular recovery after mutagen exposure. Systematic phenotyping of 1615 gene deletion strains produced distinctive signatures for each of four mutagens. Integration of the phenotyping database with mutagen-induced transcriptional profiling data demonstrated that being transcriptionally responsive to a mutagen does not predict whether or not a gene contributes to recovery from exposure to that mutagen. Computational integration of the database with 4025 interacting proteins, comprising the yeast interactome, identified several multiprotein networks important for damage recovery. Some networks were associated with DNA metabolism and cell cycle control functions, but most were associated with unexpected functions such as cytoskeleton remodeling, chromatin remodeling, protein, RNA, and lipid metabolism. Hence, a plethora of responses other than the DNA damage response is important for recovery. These network mapping results demonstrate how systematic phenotypic assays may be linked directly to underlying molecular mechanisms.

FIGURE 5. Interacting protein networks identified computationally using the Cytoscape software. A. The interactome [i] was filtered [ii] and searched [iii]. In [iii] and the rest of the figure, green nodes represent proteins associated with sensitivity, red nodes represent proteins the deletions of which are not sensitive, and gray nodes represent deletions that were not initially tested. Blue lines represent protein-protein interactions, and red arrows represent protein-DNA interactions. B. High-scoring MMS recovery pathways (1)-(4) with respective P values 31: (1) P < 0.0062; (2) P < 0.0013 (proteins highlighted in pink represent the interacting network shown in Fig. 3); (3) P < 0.0013; and (4) P < 0.0062. The high-scoring subnetworks (5) P < 0.014 and (6) P < 0.013 are combined for the t-BuOOH, 4NQO, and UV recovery pathways.
