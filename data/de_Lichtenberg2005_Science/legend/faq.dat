==ABSTRACT
To analyze the dynamics of protein complexes during the yeast cell cycle, we integrated data on protein interactions and gene expression. The resulting time-dependent interaction network places both periodically and constitutively expressed proteins in a temporal cell cycle context, thereby revealing previously unknown components and modules. We discovered that most complexes consist of both periodically and constitutively expressed subunits, which suggests that the former control complex activity by a mechanism of just-in-time assembly. Consistent with this, we show that additional regulation through targeted degradation and phosphorylation by Cdc28p (Cdk1) specifically affects the periodically expressed proteins.

==FIGURE:./fig1_lrg.jpg:./fig1_small.gif
Fig. 1. Temporal protein interaction network of the yeast mitotic cell cycle. Cell cycle proteins that are part of complexes or other physical interactions are shown within the circle. For the dynamic proteins, the time of peak expression is shown by the node color; static proteins are represented by white nodes. Outside the circle, the dynamic proteins without interactions are both positioned and colored according to their peak time and thus also serve as a legend for the color scheme in the network. More detailed versions of this figure (including all protein names) and the underlying data are available online at <a href="www.cbs.dtu.dk/cellcycle">www.cbs.dtu.dk/cellcycle.</a>

Fig. 3. Dynamic modules. Each panel shows a specific module from the network in <a href="fig1_lrg.jpg">Fig. 1</a>, using the corresponding colors of individual proteins.<br>
(A) Previously unknown module connecting processes related to chromosome structure with mitotic events in the bud. The nucleosome assembly protein Nap1p is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol and regulates the activity of Gin4p, one of two G1-expressed budding-related kinases in the module. Nap1p and the histone variant Htz1p connect the module to the nucleosome and sister chromatid modules, respectively. Two poorly characterized proteins, Nis1p and the putative Cdc28p substrate Yol070p (16), are both expressed in mitosis and localize to the bud neck (13).<br>
(B) Schematic representation of the dynamic assembly of the prereplication complex. It contains six static proteins (Orc1p to Orc6p) that are bound to origins of replication throughout the entire division cycle. A subcomplex of six Mcm proteins is recruited to the ORC complex in G1 phase by a Cdc6p-dependent mechanism; we see the corresponding genes (except MCM6) transcribed just before that. Final recruitment of the replication machinery is dependent on Cdc45p, which we find expressed in early S phase. More details and case stories are available (13).<br>
(C) Cdc28p module, with the different cyclins and interactors placed at their time of synthesis. At the end of mitosis, the cyclins are ubiquitinated and targeted for destruction by APC and SCF, reflected in the network by the interaction between Cdh1p and Clb2p. The latter also interacts with Swe1p, which inhibits entry into mitosis by phosphorylating Cdc28p in complex with Clb-type cyclins. We also discovered an uncharacterized protein, Ypl014p, in this well-studied module (13).
